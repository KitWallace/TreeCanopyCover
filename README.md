# TreeCanopyCover
Calculating and displaying tree canopy cover

code and data for the web application

https://bristoltrees.space/trees/treecover-map.xq

In full use, the data is obtained via ajax using the script canopy-data-to-js.xq.  This script uses data for multiple places in the data base so to reduce dependance this data used in the mapping has been cached which also improved the performance of the application.
